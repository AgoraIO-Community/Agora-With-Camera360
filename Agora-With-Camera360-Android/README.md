## Prepare Camera360 Prettify SDK

You need to contact Camera360 for customized SDK archives. Once you receive an SDK archive, you should find in it a prettify engine aar, a model file and a licence key string.

* Copy the aar library to `app/libs`. Here we use **PgPrettifyEngine-release.aar**, add module dependency if needed;

* Copy the model file to `app/src/main/res/raw`ï¼Œ remember to add an extension name so that it can be found in the resources (R.raw.xxx). In this project, we use **megvii_facepp.model**;

* Copy the licence key string into `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` like (replace <YOUR_KEY> with your licence key):

```
<string name="camera_360_licence"><YOUR_KEY></string>
```

Note that if you introduce this demo into your project, the Camera360 sdk must be built based on your package name. Contact Camera360 before starting your own project.

## Apply for an Agora App ID

In order to build and run the sample application you must obtain an App ID:

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Copy App id into **app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml** like: (replace <APP_ID> with your App Id)

```
<string name="camera_360_licence" translatable="false"><APP_ID></string>
```
